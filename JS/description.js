    description: ["The carbon cycle is the continuous movement of carbon between the atmosphere, land, ocean, and living organisms. It is a crucial process for life on Earth, as it maintains the carbon distribution in the Earth's system and regulates the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which affects the planet's climate.",
                  "Humans are adding more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, releasing carbon that gets stored as fossil fuels. Human interaction speeds up the release of carbon into the atmosphere, while the speed of the carbon-storing process doesn’t change much. These carbon dioxide are known as the Greenhouse Gases, which trap heat from the sun and raise the global temperature.",
                  "There are many things we can do to reduce carbon emissions, such as reducing energy consumption at home, driving less by walking or using public transportation, choosing energy-efficient appliances and electronics to save power, or even planting trees. More importantly, people can advocate for climate action or get involved in climate activism, get a good habit of saving energy, and awareness of climate change. Even though we cannot replace the use of fossil fuels in the short term, it's important to find a sustainable energy that doesn't hurt the environment."]
