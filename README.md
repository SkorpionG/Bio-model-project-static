# Biology Project - Carbon Cycle Model

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for an interactive web-based 3D model of the Earth's Carbon Cycle. It was originally developed as a final project for a high school biology class at Clovis West High School by William Chou. The application provides a visual representation of the carbon cycle, comparing primitive Earth to present-day Earth, and detailing key biological processes like photosynthesis and cellular respiration.

## Features

This project includes a variety of features to create an engaging and educational experience:

*   **Interactive 3D Models**: Utilizes Spline to render interactive 3D models that visualize different states of the Earth and biological processes.
*   **Five Educational Sections**: The application is divided into five distinct sections, each with its own 3D model and detailed description:
    *   **Primitive Earth**: Displays a model of the early Earth and provides information about its atmospheric composition.
    *   **Present Earth**: Shows a model of the modern Earth, highlighting the changes in the carbon cycle due to industrialization and life.
    *   **Photosynthesis**: Illustrates the process of photosynthesis with a dedicated model and explanation.
    *   **Cellular Respiration**: Visualizes the process of cellular respiration.
    *   **Carbon Cycle**: Presents a comprehensive overview model of the entire carbon cycle.
*   **Dynamic Content**: The content, including descriptions and models, changes dynamically as the user navigates between the different sections.
*   **Data Visualization**: Includes pie charts created with Chart.js to compare the atmospheric compositions of primitive and present-day Earth.
*   **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed to be accessible and functional across different screen sizes.
*   **Modern Web Technologies**: Built using standard web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and leverages modules for organized and maintainable code.
